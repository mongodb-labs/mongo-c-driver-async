|amongoc| Features
##################

|amongoc| is the first official asynchronous MongoDB C driver library, and
targets compatibility with the driver library APIs that are common across other
language implementations.

Because the library needs to be built from the ground-up to support asynchronous
control flow, very little of the existing C driver implementation can be used
directly, meaning that much of the feature set needs to be reimplemented. This
page documents the status of the common driver library APIs within |amongoc|.
Since the library is a proof-of-concept, many features have no target release
date, but may be added in some future production-ready version.
